# Colorful (Revisited) (ES-DE Version)
This is port of the Colorful theme (originally by [viking](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/70421-viking/) & [faeran](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/profile/76940-faeran/)) from Launchbox to [ES-DE](https://es-de.org/) v2.x

**All artwork and layouts were designed and created by viking & faeran.  I mainly translated things into the theming engine used by ES-DE. The original version of the theme can be found [here](https://forums.launchbox-app.com/files/file/2081-colorful-bigbox-theme)**

## Changes Made
- Removed all Launchbox specific elements to make the theme compatible with ES-DE v2.x
- Updated system image names to match the standard used by ES-DE
- Added support for ES-DE capabilities such as badges
